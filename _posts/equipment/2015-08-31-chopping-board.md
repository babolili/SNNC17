### Your chopping board just needs to be solid and reliable - if it seems like you could shatter it or put your knife through it, you might want to reconsider.
<p>
	Glass and Metal boards mess up your knives so are generally poor alternatives. It’s usually a good idea to have at least one wooden and one plastic board. For hygienic reasons, you want to cut/prepare raw meat and fish (especially poultry) on a plastic board, as bacteria can sometimes attach to the spongy wooden boards.	Wooden boards can be better for cutting vegetables as they absorb some of the moisture, making them less slippery.

	Ideally you should have one If you have one wooden and one plastic, you’ll know which one you use for raw meat without having to label them! (For meat/fish that you are intending to eat in a rawer state, such as beef or tuna, it will be best to prepare them on the wooden board, just to make sure there’s no possibility of contamination from the plastic boards)
