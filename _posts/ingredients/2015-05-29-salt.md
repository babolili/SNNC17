### There are quite a few different varieties of salt, but the two major groups are SEA SALT and ROCK SALT. Table salt can be processed salt from either.

The ONLY difference between different salts (unless they are flavoured salts) is the shapes and sizes of the salt crystals, which distributes the salt differently. Colour can mean that there is some kind of mineral included in the salt - but this does not particularly affect the flavour. Basically: all salts taste like salt. 

Don’t be fooled into buying expensive salts thinking that they will taste different. However, the way the salt is distributed (more uniformly or in concentrated sections) can be a matter of personal preference. Find the textures of salt that appeals to you!

PS. You can use your pestle and mortar to grind up some cheap salt and spices/herbs into flavoured salts if you’re into that kind of thing.

Some ingredients, like bacon & some cheeses, can contain a lot of salt and can sometimes be used as a replacement for salt, or should be considered when included in a recipe as they may change the balance of saltiness.
