storage: "Dry, dark and cool is best for oils, so the pantry is a good place. Oils can be kept in the fridge but some of them become cloudy or solidify if too cold, so youll have to bring them back to room temperature if you do."
lifespan: "Depends on the oil. Unopened containers will last 1-2 years. When opened, cooking oils last longer (1yr) than flavour oils (3-8 months). You can extend the life with a couple of months by refrigerating"

**COOKING OILS** should have no flavour or smell, and are usually pale yellow
in colour. Not having a flavour indicates hat it has a higher smoke point - meaning it is less likely to burn/smoke/turn into a diabolical ball of fire when you’re cooking with it. For any high temperature cooking: always use a cooking oil!

**FLAVOUR OILS** are the more expensive oils, that can contribute interesting flavours to your food. Unfortunately, most of the flavour will disappear with too much heat, and most flavoured oils have a low smoke point. If you like the flavour you can try cooking low-heat dishes with it, or just drizzle some on post-cooking. There are also flavoured oils - oils that have been flavoured by another item (chilli, garlic, truffle etc.). These are also better for lower heat or cold applications.

### DON’T GET CARRIED AWAY WITH EXPENSIVE EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OILS!!

Finding flavours you like is the most important part. Just because it is much more expensive won’t mean that the flavour will suit you more.

Also, if you can’t taste the difference between olive oils, admit to yourself that you can’t taste the difference.
