storage: "Dry, dark and cool is best for oils, so the pantry is a good place. Oils can be kept in the fridge but some of them become cloudy or solidify if too cold, so youll have to bring them back to room temperature if you do."
lifespan: "Depends on the oil. Unopened containers will last 1-2 years. When opened, cooking oils last longer (1yr) than flavour oils (3-8 months). You can extend the life with a couple of months by refrigerating"
