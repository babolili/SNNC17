### This is typical for dry-heat cooking at high temperatures, and usually because the ingredient is large and does not let heat in efficiently. 

In these types of scenarios, it is best to decrease the amount of direct heat that the ingredient is getting, and also lower the temperature. 

### Consider the following:

- How burnt is it? If you are looking at a lump of coal, you should probably be removing the burnt bits before continuing. 

- Is it in the oven? Covering it with foil will help, but the cooking time will be longer. 

- If you’ve pan-fried something, stick it in the oven under foil – there is less direct heat that way.   

- Consider the size of the ingredient – are you willing to cut it into smaller pieces? Smaller pieces will cook through quicker and decrease the amount that the ingredient burns.
