			  Students’ Nobel NightCap is created by students to celebrate the Nobel laureates. Taking place after the Nobel Banquet the 10th of December, it is a magical occasion with a different spectacular (and secret!) theme every year.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Will you be going round the world? On an adventure? Into space? Into a world of fantasy and wonder? No one knows until the party starts.

			<h2>
				The birth of a tradition
			</h2>
			<h3>
				In 1978, a student from Stockholm School of Economics, Mats Nyqvist, had a bright idea...
			</h3>
			<p>
				Why not create an after party for the most magical and exclusive night in the Swedish winter? It is said that, after many attempts, Mats got the guest list from the Nobel Banquet by a mistake, but this allowed SNNC to be started! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since then, four student unions, from the main four universities in Stockholm, are the responsible of organizing the event: Medical Students’ Association at Karolinska Institutet, Student Association at Stockholm School of Economics, Stockholm University Student Union and Tekniska Högskolan Studentkår at KTH. Every year a different university takes over the creation of an unforgettable night with the collaboration of the Nobel Foundation, the Swedish Industry and the help of many, many students!

			  Who is hosting this year's party?
			</h3>
			<p>
				This year the party will be hosted by Medicinska Föreningen at Karolinska institutet
			</p>
			<h3>
				Who gets to go? 
			</h3>
			<p>
				Everyone who attends the Nobel Banquet receives an open invitation to the party - it is an afterparty for the Nobel banquet after all!
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to the banquet guests, we invite some of the people who have helped us make the night a reality, including our sponsors. And the rest of the tickets go to our lovely students!
			</p>
			<p>
				The size of the venue puts a limit on how many tickets will be available - as we get closer to the date we will let you know how to have a shot at the tickets.

				What's the theme this year?

			<p>
				Secret, as always ;)
