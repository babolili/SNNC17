        <h3>
          The Honest Guide to Cooking is an online resource with advice about how to go about cooking.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The online version of the guide will be periodically updated until it contains all the information that is in the book - but if you can't wait or if you want to show your support, go ahead and <a href="">grab a copy here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Guide contains no recipes - it is a guide to cooking, not a cookbook. It gives you a general understanding of what cooking is about, not a detailed explanation of everything that is or isn’t cooking, it will not fill you with the inspiration or know-how to create “culinary masterpieces”. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Guide is for anyone who has at some point decided “I will cook this year” and given up because they could not be bothered to get into cooking literature.

          It will at the very least teach you something that resembles cooking skills.
