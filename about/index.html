          The Honest Guide - an Introduction
        </h2>
        <h3>
          The Honest Guide to Cooking is an online resource with advice about how to go about cooking.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The online version of the guide will be periodically updated until it contains all the information that is in the book - but if you can't wait or if you want to show your support, go ahead and <a href="/ebook">grab a copy here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Guide contains no recipes - it is a guide to cooking, not a cookbook. It gives you a general understanding of what cooking is about, not a detailed explanation of everything that is or isn’t cooking, it will not fill you with the inspiration or know-how to create “culinary masterpieces”. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Cooking is a subject that should in many ways be straightforward to most of us, seeing as most of us do it (to some degree) on a daily basis. But in later years, cooking has been bogged down by ideas around health, environmental concerns, animal welfare, social status and cultural heritage. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The worries about buying quality food and equipment, about what is high and low cuisine, about whether or not we are cooking things that are good for out bodies or our kids or whether we are really making the perfect chicken for our guests - well, it's not <b>really</b> about cooking at all. You could say cooking has been hijacked by ideology. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          That's why I wrote this guide: It's an attempt to step back from all the opinions about cooking - and try to find out what cooking looks like when you strip out all the ideological baggage. The honest guide to cooking is about being curious, about messing up, about finding fun and easy ways to do things. 
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Guide is for anyone who has at some point decided “I will cook this year” and given up because they could not be bothered to get into cooking literature. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          It will at the very least teach you something that resembles cooking skills.
