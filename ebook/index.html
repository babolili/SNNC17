			<h1>The Ebook</h1>
			<h3>
				Don't worry - this is not a hard sell section.
			</h3>
			<p>
				The Honest Guide to Cooking is a labour of love, not a get rich quick scheme. But the original honest guide to cooking was designed as a book, and I thought it would be a shame not to share that with you. Most of the content in the book will be uploaded onto the site and be freely available, but reading the book as a whole is obviously a different experience. Proceeds from the ebook sales will go towards hosting costs for the online version of the honest guide to cooking, and for freeing up some time so I can add and create new content.

					Info

				<h3>
					What format if the ebook in?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The ebook is currently offered as a PDF version that you can read on either your computer or tablet. It will also be available on apple iBooks and Google Play Books in a short while, so if you prefer those formats, it may be worth waiting.
				</p>
				<p>
					The PDF comes prepackaged with table of contents bookmarks for easier navigation
				</p>
				<h3>Is the transaction safe?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, the download is handled by <a href="https://simplegoods.co/" target="_blank"> Simple Goods</a> who pass the transaction through <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> - a super safe and widely used payment system. I could offer a PayPal option if you'd prefer but it costs to implement. If you'd like a paypal option, please leave a comment about it below! 
				</p>
				<h3>
					If I don't like it, can I get a refund?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Unfortunately not - it's a digital download so once you have the file, you have it and there's no real way for you to give it back. It's kind of like when you buy underwear in a clothes store - no matter how much you try to guarantee you haven't worn it, it's just too hard to tell (although maybe not as unhygienic as that example). If you find an error or something isn't working I'll try my best to help you though. Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:info@honestguidetocooking.com">info@honestguidetocooking.com</a> (please don't be upset if it takes a while for me to get back to you)
